/**
 * timers — fairfox's deterministic wait primitives.
 *
 * Fixed-duration sleeps written inline — `await new Promise((r) =>
 * setTimeout(r, n))` — are banned across the codebase;
 * `scripts/check-no-fixed-waits.ts` enforces it. A fixed sleep guesses
 * how long an operation takes: too short and the test flakes on a
 * loaded machine, too long and every run wastes that time. The guess
 * is never right, only un-noticed.
 *
 * This file is the single sanctioned home for timer-backed waiting.
 * Three primitives, each for a distinct intent:
 *
 * - `pollUntil(condition, opts)` — wait for something to become true.
 *   Re-checks a real condition on an interval and resolves the instant
 *   it holds. The delay is a poll cadence, never an assumption about
 *   completion. This is the one blessed timer-based wait.
 * - `flushMicrotasks()` — let an already-scheduled promise chain
 *   settle. No timer at all: it yields exactly one microtask turn, so
 *   it is precise, not a guess. The test-side replacement for a tiny
 *   "give it a moment" sleep.
 * - `delay(ms)` — the one sanctioned fixed delay. Legal ONLY where the
 *   wait itself is the intended behaviour: retry/reconnect backoff,
 *   the cadence between polls of an external service, holding out a
 *   lease expiry. Never to "give the code a moment".

 *
 * Replaces a fixed sleep with an explicit success criterion: the wait ends the
 * moment the condition holds. The recursive `setTimeout(attempt, ...)` is the
 * poll cadence — its callback does real work (re-evaluating the condition),
 * which is what separates a poll from a sleep.
